**cornell_schedule_gen** This project is a program to help students determine and evaluate potential schedules for a semester.
Given classes that a student would want to take, and their preferred time availability (including lectures, labs,
discussion sections, and AEWs), the program returns all possible schedules sorted from least to most time overlap
(if any exist). It is designed to be a tool to simplify choosing classes and pre-enrolling. 

Please check our INSTALL.md for instructions on how to get RCR working on your system! Requires that you have node installed.
