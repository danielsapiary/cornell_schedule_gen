This project is a program to help students determine and evaluate potential schedules for a semester. 
Given classes that a student would want to take, and their time availability,
 the program would return all possible schedules if any exist.
It is designed to be a tool to be used to simplify choosing classes and pre-enroll.
 This program is designed to be used by students at Cornell University, and is accessed by a web interface.
