To our wonderful PG

Here is the command you want to use to measure the size of our project: 
cloc --exclude-dir=frontend --include-lang=OCaml .

This excludes the frontend code written exclusively in ReactJS, and only counts the OCaml LOC.
Note that the original command that we were given would also accurately count the
LOC but it will take much longer as it will search through all the files in the 
frontend


Alternatively, you can the following command before you use cloc:
rm -r frontend/node_modules

This way, cloc won't take forever to run
